Summary:
a concise and on point explanation about the inner mechanics of Houdini. First viewing is recommended prior to learning controls, as the video gives you an idea of what the software is like. Second viewing is recommended after learning the controls so as to start working with Houdini on a deeper level.

-Quartz Crystal by Moritz Schwind (https://vimeo.com/205629784)

Summary - a tutorial which explains the basic principles of modeling, implementation of VDB in modelling process, shader creation and rendering specifics within Houdiniâ€™s Mantra render engine.

-Procedural Vehicle Modelling by Kenny Lammers (https://www.udemy.com/course/vehicle-modeling-in-houdini-16-scifi-dropship/)

Summary - a full production tutorial that takes the users through basic modelling and detailing, implementation of procedural tools, coding in VEX language, UVing, texturing, and implementation of game engines in rendering process.

Side note:

As of now it's a permanent work in-progress, I will keep updating it with more references and create new folders to cover more topics.
